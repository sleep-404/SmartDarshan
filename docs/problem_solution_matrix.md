# SmartDarshan: Problem-Solution Analysis Matrix

| **Category** | **Available Data/Infrastructure** | **Core Problem** | **Potential AI/Tech Solution** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Video Analytics** | 324 CCTV cameras (4MP HIKVISION IP), HikCentral VMS, 90-day recordings | Cameras used only for manual viewing and playback; no automated intelligence | Real-time crowd density estimation, congestion hotspot detection, anomaly detection (stampede patterns, overcrowding) — integrated via HikCentral APIs |
| **Zone-Specific Monitoring** | Camera coverage across 11 zones: Temple core, Queue, Parking, Annadanam, Prasadam, Gosala, Counters, Choulties, Sub-temples, Tanks, Kesakandana Sala | No zone-wise crowd analytics; blind spots in operational visibility | Per-zone density dashboards — parking availability, meal queue length, prasadam counter load, darshan queue status |
| **Crowd Forecasting** | 5 years daily footfall data (CCTV counting + manual), weather records (22-29°C, 60-90% humidity) | Static peak hour assumption (8AM-1:30PM); no predictive modeling | ML forecasting model using historical footfall + weather + humidity to predict hourly crowd volumes |
| **Event-Based Prediction** | Specific event calendar: Mukkoti Ekadasi, Kalyanotsavams, Dasara, Sankranthi, April-May, every Saturday/Sunday | Generic "festival" handling; no event-specific preparation | Event-type specific prediction models — different crowd patterns for Ekadasi vs Sankranthi vs regular weekends |
| **Gate Management** | 4 Gopurams (South, East, West, North-entry only), manually controlled by security | No data-driven gate load balancing; decisions on gut feel | Real-time gate recommendation engine — "Open West Gopuram, restrict South" based on live zone density + predicted inflow |
| **Spatial Crowd Flow** | Master Plan / Layout maps, Geo-coordinates (16.9499°N, 81.2991°E) | No crowd flow modeling; barricade placement ad-hoc | Spatial simulation using layout maps — optimal barricade placement, evacuation route planning, bottleneck identification |
| **Queue Management** | Queue waiting time data, current manual diversion approach | Reactive interventions after congestion builds | Predictive congestion alerts 15-30 mins ahead; automated queue routing recommendations to staff |
| **Devotee Guidance** | No current real-time communication channel | Devotees have no visibility into wait times, gate status, facilities | Multilingual chatbot/IVR (Telugu, Hindi, English) via WhatsApp/SMS/voice — live wait times, best entry gate, optimal visit timing |
| **Amenity Navigation** | Inventory of amenities: water points, toilets, prasadam counters, annadanam halls, first aid, wheelchair/elderly support | Devotees don't know nearest facility locations | Chatbot integration with amenity mapping — "Nearest toilet is 50m east", accessibility routing for elderly/disabled |
| **Parking Management** | Parking zones covered by CCTV | No real-time parking availability info | Vehicle counting via CCTV — parking slot availability, redirect to alternate lots when full |
| **Feedback Analysis** | 1 year audio/video feedback, complaint registers, phone records | Feedback sits unused; manual review only | Speech-to-text → sentiment analysis, auto-categorize complaints, identify recurring issues for operational fixes |
| **Staff Deployment** | Face attendance system + manual rosters for security, temple staff, sanitation, volunteers | No dynamic staff allocation based on crowd conditions | Staff deployment recommendations based on predicted crowd — more personnel at high-density zones |
| **Automated Alerts** | PA system exists, used for manual announcements | No threshold-based automated escalation | Crowd density threshold → auto-trigger PA announcements + dashboard alerts + SMS to staff |
| **Emergency Response** | Drill protocols for fire, stampede, medical, power failure, natural calamities | Protocols activated manually; no early warning triggers | AI-triggered protocol activation — detected stampede pattern → auto-alert security + PA + evacuation route display |
| **Incident Prevention** | Incident logs (no major incidents, occasional queue delays) | Reactive handling of queue delays | Pattern recognition on past delays → preemptive alerts before similar conditions recur |
| **Infrastructure Constraints** | 4MP HIKVISION cameras, HikCentral VMS | Solution must work within existing infra, not require replacement | Edge-compatible models for 4MP resolution; HikCentral API integration; no new camera hardware |
| **Offline Resilience** | Remote temple zones may have connectivity issues | No fallback for network failures | Edge processing on local servers; deferred sync when online; SMS/IVR fallback for devotee communication |
